<p>Computer is an amazing product, I fall in love with it in the first encounter.We have our first computer at 
home when I was 9 years old, what my parents told me  is that it has a lot of games in there that I can play.
I ended up diving deep into computer and look for what entertains me. And there comes my whole childhood life.
</br>
With my early and deep connection with computer, I decided to take CST major when I grow up. So that I can know 
how computer actually work under the hood. It is amazing, but I want to know what makes it amazing and how to 
make it happen. That is my main passion to learn coding.
